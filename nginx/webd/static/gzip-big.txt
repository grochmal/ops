This is a longer file, which should be compressed by the nginx gzip module.
To test it with curl one can use --compressed and curl itself will use zlib
to decompress it back into plain text.

Note that this file needs to be longer than nginx's gzip_min_length in order
to be compressed on the fly.

Mom, I'm uncompressed now!
